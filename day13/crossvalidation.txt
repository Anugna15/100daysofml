## üß† Theoretical Concepts

### ‚úÖ What is Model Evaluation?
Model evaluation is the process of assessing how well your machine learning model is performing on unseen data (test data).  
It helps in checking if the model is underfitting, overfitting, or generalizing properly.

---

### ‚úÖ Important Evaluation Metrics:

- **Accuracy**:  
  Proportion of correctly predicted observations to total observations.  
  `Accuracy = (TP + TN) / (TP + TN + FP + FN)`

- **Precision**:  
  When the model predicts positive, how often is it correct?  
  `Precision = TP / (TP + FP)`

- **Recall (Sensitivity or True Positive Rate)**:  
  When the actual value is positive, how often does the model predict positive?  
  `Recall = TP / (TP + FN)`

- **F1 Score**:  
  Harmonic mean of Precision and Recall. A balance between the two.  
  `F1 Score = 2 * (Precision * Recall) / (Precision + Recall)`

- **ROC AUC Score (Receiver Operating Characteristic - Area Under Curve)**:  
  Measures the model‚Äôs ability to distinguish between classes.  
  1.0 = perfect model, 0.5 = random guessing.

- **Confusion Matrix**:  
  A matrix showing true vs predicted values to visualize performance.

## üî• Practical Steps (Code Summary)

### 1. **Loading Datasets**:
- Breast Cancer
- Iris

### 2. **Data Preprocessing**:
- Converted `target` to numeric category.
- Scaled features using `StandardScaler`.

### 3. **Model Training**:
- Model used: **Random Forest Classifier** (Ensemble technique based on decision trees).
- Trained on both Breast Cancer and Iris datasets.

### 4. **Model Evaluation**:
- Predictions on the test set.
- Calculated:
  - Accuracy
  - Precision
  - Recall
  - F1 Score
  - ROC AUC Score
  - Confusion Matrix
  - Classification Report
